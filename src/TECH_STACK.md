# Technology Stack for FarmAssist AI

This document outlines the key technologies and frameworks used to build the FarmAssist AI application. Our stack was chosen to enable rapid development, scalability, and the seamless integration of powerful AI features.

### **Frontend**

*   **Next.js (App Router):** The core React framework. We use the App Router for its server-centric rendering model, which improves performance and allows for clean data-fetching patterns.
*   **React & TypeScript:** React is used for building the user interface with a component-based architecture. TypeScript adds static typing to enhance code quality and developer productivity.
*   **Progressive Web App (PWA):** The application is configured as a PWA (`next-pwa`) to enable offline capabilities and allow users to "install" it on their mobile devices for a native-app-like experience.

### **UI & Styling**

*   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid styling directly within the HTML, ensuring a consistent design system.
*   **ShadCN UI:** A collection of beautifully designed, accessible, and unstyled components that are copied directly into the project, giving us full control over their code and appearance.

### **AI & Machine Learning**

*   **Genkit:** The open-source framework from Google used to build, manage, and deploy AI-powered features. It orchestrates the interactions between our application and the underlying language models.
*   **Google Gemini Models:** The powerful suite of generative AI models that power all intelligent features, including the multilingual chatbot, disease detection from images, and the generation of personalized recommendations.

### **Backend & Database**

*   **Firebase:** A comprehensive backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform from Google.
    *   **Firestore:** A flexible, scalable NoSQL cloud database used to store and sync data in real-time, such as the live crop and seed market prices.
    *   **Firebase Hosting (via App Hosting):** The platform where the Next.js application is deployed, providing a fast, secure, and globally-distributed content delivery network.
